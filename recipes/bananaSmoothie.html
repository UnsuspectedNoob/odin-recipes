        "We are really into almond butter and almond milk lately, so I subbed
        those for the milk and peanut butter," says LatinaCook. "Though I did
        use the honey, it might not even be necessary."
      </p>

      <p>
        In place of honey, TexanEats swapped in a scoop of chocolate whey
        protein powder: "That chocolate /banana /peanut butter combination is
        yummy. A nice change from our berry smoothies."

        "I added 2 tablespoons of Nutella instead of honey and....Yum!" says
        northparkgemini.

        Caroline added in a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and "switched out the
        honey with agave nectar."Lisa personalized her banana smoothie with
        frozen bananas and omitted the ice. "I also used crunchy almond butter
        and unsweetened vanilla almond milk and added a handful of spinach
        leaves and a tablespoon of flax seed."

        "I replaced 1 cup of the milk with one cup of plain Greek yogurt to make
        it a little thicker," says Brooke.

        "It was super delicious," says Jahnvi. "I also added a splash of vanilla
        extract and caramel syrup."

    <h2>How to Freeze Bananas for Banana Smoothies</h2>
    <p>
      Though the recipe itself doesn't call for frozen bananas, many reviewers
      recommend it. Freezing bananas is a great way to preserve them for future
      smoothies. Here's an easy way to freeze bananas for smoothies:
    </p>

    <p>
      Peel the bananas and cut them into 1-inch pieces. Arrange the banana
      slices on a baking sheet and slide the sheet into the freezer. When the
      pieces have frozen, transfer them into a resealable freezer bag and store
      in the freezer until smoothie time!
